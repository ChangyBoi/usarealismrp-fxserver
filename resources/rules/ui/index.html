				<h1>Random Deathmath &amp; Vehicle Deathmatch</h1>
				<h2>It is forbidden for other players to kill each other without little to no roleplay. This is to include the use of vehicles. Before a player can kill another player, to include the police &amp; EMS, all players must be engaged in roleplay.</h2>
			</div>
			<div>&nbsp;</div>
			<div class="innerbox">
				<h1>Realistic Behavior</h1>
				<h2>All players shall conduct themselves in a realistic manner. Despite game mechanics, it is the player's responsibility to act "realistic." If struck by a moving vehicle at a high rate of speed and your health bar barely depletes, you are not, in real life, going to get up and run around.</h2>
			</div>
			<div>&nbsp;</div>
			<div class="innerbox">
				<h1>Meta-Gaming is Forbidden</h1>
				<h2>All players have their ID numbers's above their heads which is to assist admins and law enforcement (special LEO commands). Players, to include officers & EMS, are not allowed to use a player's ID number to find them behind buildings, inside vehicles with tented windows, or "recognize" the player after not seeing them for a period of time and they have changed their player skin/vehicle when they had never provided you their name.</h2>
			</div>
			<div>&nbsp;</div>
			<div class="innerbox">
				<h1>Powergaming is Forbidden</h1>
				<h2>Our definition of powergaming is the abuse of in-game mechanics to give you an unrealistic advantage that benefits the player(s). Don't do it.</h2>
			</div>
			<div>&nbsp;</div>
			<div class="innerbox">
				<h1>Cop Baiting</h1>
				<h2>It is forbidden for player's to cop bait officers. If an officer is busy with a crime scene such as a bank robbery or a murder or they are engaged in role play, be sure to let them finish.</h2>
			</div>
			<div>&nbsp;</div>
			<div class="innerbox">
				<h1>Must Have a Microphone</h1>
				<h2>Players without microphones are subject to being kicked. Lacking a microphone not only ruins the role play experience but causes unnecessary chat spam and ruins the flow of role play. <i>The "N" key is the default push-to-talk while in game.</i></h2>
			</div>
			<div>&nbsp;</div>
			<div class="innerbox">
				<h1>New Life Rules</h1>
				<h2>If your character dies in a realistic manner (i.e. being burned alive, shot multiple times, stabbed, or even involved in a serious vehicle accident), you are not to "remember" anything from your previous life.</h2>
			</div>
			<div>&nbsp;</div>
			<div class="innerbox">
				<h1>Vehicle Use</h1>
				<h2>If driving a vehicle other than a motorcycle, a player is not allowed to shoot at any other vehicle or player. Their vehicle must be stationary to shoot from the driver seat. If a player is riding passenger, they are allowed to shoot inarticulately at other players/vehicles. Drivers on motorcycles are allowed to shoot inaccurately at other players/vehicles. Constantly driving at high rates of speeds in populated areas is also forbidden. Spamming the car horns is a community annoyance and shall not be done.</h2>
			</div>
			<div>&nbsp;</div>
			<div class="innerbox">
				<h1>Fail Role Play or FailRP</h1>
				<h2>This is when a player, well, fails role play to gain an advantage on another player.</h2>
			</div>
			<div>&nbsp;</div>
			<div class="innerbox">
				<h1>Bank Rules</h1>
				<h2>The bank vault is only open if there are two or more officers online. Using the bank teller is authorized regardless if officers are on or offline. If players plan on doing a heist, which includes 2 or more robbers, then there must be three or more officers online. It is the player's responsibility to ask if the bank is open upon logging into the server. Players will not be chastised for asking.</h2>
			</div>
			<div>&nbsp;</div>
			<div class="innerbox">

			</div>
			<div>&nbsp;</div>
			<div class="innerbox">
				<h1>DO NOT SPAM CHAT</h1>
				<h2>The chat box is a privilege and not a right. Abusing it will get you kicked or banned. No matter what the issue is, no player is authorized to spam chat. You will be warned, kicked, then banned. You must use /ooc for any OOC discussions.</h2>
